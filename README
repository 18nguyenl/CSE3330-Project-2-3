Covid-19 Database Front-end Website
===============================

## Before using...

The name of the database is assumed to be `covid19`. 

We are using a `XAMPP` setup where http://localhost/covid19/ is where the website
will run.

Everything should be stored in the `XAMPP` `htcdocs/covid19` directory.
